### Vision Statement
Our vision is to give users access to data generated by their vehicles through an easy-to-use mobile application. 

### Project Summary - [Link to Presentation](https://youtu.be/K3SsSIVR6p8)
With our project, we set out to design an easy-to-use mobile application for users to access data and error codes generated by their vehicles. The ability to access vehicle data is not a new one, but we sought to simplify the process for users that may not need all of the overhead generated by some apps on the market today. Instead, we focused on stripping away the noise and focusing on a smaller number of core areas.

The application we've developed is cross-platform and compatible with both Android and iOS mobile phones. This was done by using the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) for web-based cross-platform application development. This platform uses TypeScript as a foundational language with HTML and CSS offering support for page structure and style respectively. This platform allowed us to use a single [code base](https://github.com/Car-Maintenance-Senior-Project/OBD-ME) for both iOS and Android platforms, since Ionic would take care of styling the app for the appropriate operating system. 

One feature of the app that Ty used for his honors project is the ability to visualize fuel economy data on a digital map. This involves using the Google Maps JavaScript API and calculating real-time fuel economy data. This real-time data is then compared to a stored historical MPG average and evaluated. This evaluated data is then plotted on the map with different colors according to how close the real-time MPG is to the historical MPG of the vehicle. All told, this feature allows users to visualize their fuel economy history and determine locations that cause issues with fuel economy or habits that should change (e.g. high acceleration after being stationary).
