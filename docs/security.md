## Notes on Security of OBD Devices

  There are 3 broad types of OBD tools.  The first is reader that will just read all the hex codes traveling over the bus.  The second is a scanner which is what we use.  The way a scanner works is it querrys the car (I think the main comp/hub) and it responds with the requested data.  It is read only except for requests, and anything that isn't formatted as a valid request is dropped by the chip.  These types of OBD devices can still be sniffed, however, there isn't any data that can be sniffed that you couldn't get by looking at the car or through the windows.  There is an occasional report of finding a back door in a specific device, however, it has so far been isolated to specific device lines and not the main OBD scanner chip (ELM327).  Lastly, for anyone to even be able to interface with these devices, it would be either through bluetooth or wire and the vehicle would have to be turned on.  This imposes physical range limits and bluetooth even requires a password (though manufactures usually make it 1234 or something).  The last type is an OBD spoofer (not the technical name for it, but these aren't exactly widely used for obvious security risks).  Basically, these are the tools that allow you to actually control and affect your car.  They basically pretend to be part of your car, and can be used to splice and add data to the bus.

  Last thing I want to say is that if someone actually wanted to hack your car, they wouldn't do it through the OBD most likely.  Most cars have much greater security risks than the OBD port since the system as a whole wasn't designed with safety in mind.  There are examples of cars being able to be controlled over cellular from anywhere in the world.  There are readily available wires that anyone can access on a car where all you have to do is connect a device smaller than the palm of my hand to be able to control the car.  My point is there are much simpler ways to hack a car than through an OBD scanner.  The good news is that car manufacturers are starting to make security more of a priority, and that currently, there are much cheaper ways to steal cars than by hacking them.  So, the security risks that our app, by using an OBD scanner, provides are extremely small when compared to the risks that are already present in a car.  Were also using proper data hiding methods in our app to keep it as secure as possible.  While I do admit that the security isn't perfect, in my opinion the blame really falls on the car manufacturers for how lazy they've been when it comes to these security vulnerabilities.
